  Welcome to my portfolio â€” a curated space where I share the projects I've built, the challenges Iâ€™ve tackled, and the lessons Iâ€™ve learned along the way.  
  When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy working out, digging into deep tech research, and getting hands-on with DIY projects â€” lately, Iâ€™ve been learning to build a deck from scratch.  
  I spend a lot of time gaming on PC, mostly playing Counter-Strike 2, but Iâ€™ve also recently picked up Terraria, Black Myth: Wu Kong, Elden Ring, God of War: Ragnarok, Nine Sols, and Hollow Knight. I gravitate toward games that challenge skill, offer deep worldbuilding, or push artistic design.  
  In the winter, I love snowboarding â€” I currently ride a 2023â€“2024 Bataleon Disaster with Flux DS bindings, and still have my 2022â€“2023 Burton Process in rotation.  
  I also enjoy checking out new coffee shops around town. Whether youâ€™re here to explore my work, connect over shared interests, or just learn more â€” thanks for stopping by.
